        <h2>I Want to Eat Your Pancreas:</h2>
        <p>Haruki Shiga is an anti-social loner who prefers to spend his time with books and is not held in high esteem in his class. Full of life and full of character, Sakura Yamauchi is loved by everyone with her open and sunny personality. The two could hardly be more different and yet one day they become inseparable. While waiting in the hospital to be called, Haruki finds a small book - "Living with Death" - a diary that describes the daily life of a dying person. It doesn't take long for the owner of the book to show up: his classmate Sakura. Sakura suffers from a disease of the pancreas and although medical advances allow her to live an almost normal life, she will soon die. That's something she's kept secret from all her friends, though, because what she needs in this last time on earth isn't pity, it's real normalcy - normality, which she finds in Haruki, who is now going from being a "simple classmate" to a "classmate who knows my secret." So Haruki gets carried away by Sakura and the more time the two spend together, the more they find themselves caught up in a storm of feelings they can't explain themselves. "Friendship"? "Love"? Such trivial words are not enough to describe the relationship between the two. "Let's enjoy the world until I die, okay?" - these are her words and so the free spirit Sakura breaks down Haruki's hard shell piece by piece and he begins to see the world with different eyes...</p>
